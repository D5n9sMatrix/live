' Theorem 1.2.2. Let X and Y be sets, and let f : X â†’ Y. Then, the following
' statements hold:
' i) f is left invertible if and only if f is one-to-one.
' ii) f is right invertible if and only if f is onto.
' Furthermore, the following statements are equivalent:
' iii) f is invertible.
' iv) f has a unique inverse.
' v) f is one-to-one and onto.
' vi) f is left invertible and right invertible.
' vii) f has a unique left inverse.
' viii) f has a unique right inverse.
