LOL, that documentation page is totally out of sync with ansible-core, which nolonger runs on 2.x, as it requires 3.8
i am not sure where this docs comes from
probably due to confusions about requirements for ansible runtime, and for remote hosts, which are different.
from the linter perspective we only care about where ansible-core runs, as we need it. we don't connect to any remote hosts.

it's the first result when searching for "ansible supported python versions"

 personally don't mind dropping 3.6/3.7 but why keep 3.8? It got the same python support status. 
Is it N/N-2 or just a "follow the community" approach?

though the google apps are configured by adding panels to the settings, so it's kinda but not really part of the settings

lul
indeed
now i killed it
so if I type into google search "weather in" and then start typing various city names
it shows the temperature in the suggest bar
but if while I'm doing it, I change the temperature unit on my phone, it switches the lookups
so now it has some cities cached in fahrenheit and some in celsius

good to know those updates propagate that quickly
but then, it's a weather setting, you'd hope it happens in the cloud
